# Changelog

All notable changes to Sumyard are listed here, newest first. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are 0.x: a minor bump for each merged part, a patch bump for each follow-up fix. Entries are written for the person using the app, because they also feed the in-app What's new.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added
- **Tax data:** a new page listing each tax year Sumyard has, grouped by topic: income tax, National Insurance, student loans, pensions, Child Benefit and childcare. Each group shows how many of its figures are verified, and each verified figure will show its value, a link to its GOV.UK source and the date it was checked. Open it from **About Sumyard**, **Settings** or the Help topic on tax data.
- **No tax figures yet:** every figure for 2026 to 2027 is marked **Not yet verified**. Sumyard holds the structure only; the figures are checked against GOV.UK before any calculator uses them, and a calculator will show no results while a figure it needs is unchecked.
- **Settings:** a default **Tax year** (2026 to 2027), labelled “not yet verified” while its figures are unchecked. Your existing settings carry over.
- A **“last verified” label** shows a tax year and either **Not yet verified** or the date of its latest check. It appears on the Tax data page now, and next to calculator results later.

### Changed
- The menu now says only “Changes are saved in this browser.” Export arrives with scenarios.
- Help: the tax data topic describes the Tax data page and the “last verified” label, and Quick start and Troubleshooting mention them.

### Fixed
- Tips in Help are read by screen readers as notes inside the page, not as a separate region.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added
- **Menu:** the menu button in the top bar opens **Settings**, **Help and what’s new** and **About Sumyard**. **Scenarios** is listed as coming soon.
- **Help:** a Quick start and topics on saving, tax data and troubleshooting. Pages open from the bottom on a phone and from the side on a larger screen. Use the back arrow, your browser’s Back button or `Esc` to step back, and each page has its own address you can bookmark.
- **What’s new:** this list, with a **New** marker on the menu until you open it.
- **About:** the version and build, how much Sumyard stores in this browser, a **Copy details** button for reporting problems, the privacy statement, the disclaimer and credits for the open-source packages Sumyard uses.
- **Settings:** theme (the same choice as the top-bar button), a default region (England, Wales or Northern Ireland, or Scotland) and whether amounts show whole pounds or pounds and pence. No calculator uses these yet. **Reset settings to defaults** can be undone.
- **Notifications** appear at the bottom with an **Undo** button where one applies, and stay while you hover over or focus them.
- A short **Before you start** notice explains that results are illustrative, not financial advice. **Got it** hides it on this device.

### Changed
- The illustrative-not-advice disclaimer is now at the foot of every page.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added
- **Sumyard is live:** a first, empty page with light and dark themes. The theme button in the top bar cycles through **System**, **Light** and **Dark**, and Sumyard remembers your choice on this device.
- The home page says what Sumyard is for, that calculators are on the way, and that its results are illustrative, not financial advice.
